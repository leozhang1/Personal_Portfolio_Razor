_ViewStart.cshtml gets executed first
but could be overwrote and not have an effect on razor pages that have:

@{
    Layout = null;
}

We can also have multiple layouts and we're not restricted to using only the _layout.cshtml file provided

<vc></vc> tag is for view components
<partial></partial> is for partial views
